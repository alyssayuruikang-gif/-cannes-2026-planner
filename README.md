## Notes on data and accuracy

- **Travel times** are straight-line (Haversine) estimates: walking at 5 km/h, scooter at 15 km/h plus a 2-min unlock buffer. The festival shuttle is modelled at ~18 min including average wait time, and only between the Palais and Cineum (the only campus-to-campus route it serves).
- **Inside the Palais des Festivals** (Lumière, Debussy, Buñuel, Agnès Varda, Bazin) and inside Cineum (IMAX, Aurore, Screen X, Salle 3) we count 3 minutes per transfer to allow for re-entry queues.
- **Black tie (gala) marker** is applied to the headline 19:00 / evening-time premieres in the Grand Théâtre Lumière. This is a heuristic — for any specific screening, check the festival's official guidelines.
- **Source data**: official *Horaires des projections* guide of the Festival de Cannes 2026.
